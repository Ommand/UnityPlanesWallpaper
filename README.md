# Unity Planes Wallpaper
This repository purpose is to create an example of using tiled map loader ([OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles)), simple path movement ([DotWeen](http://dotween.demigiant.com/)), and a simple simulation that can be used as wallpaper via [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/).
## Current progress
- [x] Make a simulation act normally
- [ ] Automatically select viewport location on the map
- [x] Flying logic
- [ ] Make the program work with [Wallpaper Engine](https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/)
